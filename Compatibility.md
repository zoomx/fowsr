# Details #

The [EasyWeather](http://fowsr.googlecode.com/files/2009526181448.zip) application can read weather data from all weather stations with USB port that are compatible with **fowsr**. The latest version is always available from the Fine Offset Electronic's [web site](http://www.foshk.com/en/products/show.asp?id=42).

If the [EasyWeather](http://fowsr.googlecode.com/files/2009526181448.zip) application can read your weather station, then the **fowsr** application will work. The [EasyWeather](http://fowsr.googlecode.com/files/2009526181448.zip) software is also needed to configure the weather station's read interval, time zone and relative pressure.
